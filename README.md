| 12 | Air Quality Analysis with GGally | An R script analyzing the air quality dataset using the GGally package for creating a matrix of scatterplots between variables, and ggplot2 for visualizing individual plots.|
| 13 |Boxplot of Monthly Temperature in New York City | This R script reads in the airquality dataset and creates a boxplot of the temperature for each month in New York City. |
| 14 |Boxplot of Pre-treatment Weights for Three Anorexia Treatment Groups | This script creates a boxplot with points overlaid to compare the pre-treatment weights of patients in three different treatment groups for anorexia.|
| 15 |Analysis of Daily Total Precipitation in Boulder Creek from August to October 2013 | This R code reads daily precipitation data from a CSV file, filters the data to include observations from August to October 2013, and creates a bar plot of the daily total precipitation during the selected period. |
| 16 |Daily Precipitation - Boulder, Colorado  from 2003 to 2013|This script reads in a dataset containing daily precipitation values in inches for Boulder, Colorado from 2003 to 2013.The data is also faceted by year to show how precipitation varies over time.|
| 17 | Monthly Total Daily Precipitation in Boulder, Colorado from 2003 to 2013 | This script reads in a daily precipitation dataset for Boulder, Colorado from 2003 to 2013 and aggregates the data by month and year to create a bar chart of monthly total daily precipitation. |
| 18 | Stream Discharge (CFS) - Boulder Creek 1986-2016 | This script reads in daily stream discharge data for Boulder Creek for the years 1986-2013 and creates a scatter plot of the discharge values for the period between 1986-2016 |
| 19 | Daily Total Precipitation - Boulder Station, 1948-2013 | This script reads in daily precipitation data from Boulder Station spanning from 1948 to 2013, and calculates the total daily precipitation for each day from January to September 2013.  |
| 20 | Visualization of Stream Discharge Time Series with Plotly and DyGraph | This script reads in a daily stream discharge dataset spanning from 1986-2013, and creates interactive time series visualizations of the data using the dygraphs package.  |
| 21 | Life Expectancy over Time in Ghana |  This script loads life expectancy data from the World Bank and continent data from Our World in Data, cleans and processes the data using dplyr and tidyr, and then creates a plot of Ghana's life expectancy over time from 1960 to 2022 using ggplot2. The plot shows a scatter plot of the data points and a line connecting them. |
| 22 | Interactive Histogram of Random Value with Shiny & R plot|  This script generates a histogram of a user-specified number of random values between 0 and 1 using Shiny slider. The histogram displays the frequency distribution of the generated values. Additionally, the script calculates and displays the mean, median, and standard deviation of the generated values. |
| 23 |Interactive Scatterplot with Correlation and Regression Line |  This script generates a histogram of a user-specified number of random values between 0 and 1 using Shiny slider. The plot is displayed using ggplot2, and summary statistics including mean, median, and standard deviation are displayed below the plot.|
| 24 | Interactive Histogram of Random Value with Shiny & GGplot |  This script uses the shiny package to create an interactive scatterplot with the airquality dataset. The plot includes a regression line and displays the correlation coefficient between the selected variables on the x-axis and y-axis. |
